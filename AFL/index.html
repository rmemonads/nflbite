    The <strong>Australian Football League (AFL)</strong> is one of the most exciting and fast-paced sports competitions in the world. 
    Originating in Australia, AFL blends the skills of football, rugby, and athletics into a unique game that has gained millions of 
    passionate fans both locally and internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are watching <strong>AFL live streams</strong>, catching highlights on TV, or following the league from overseas, this guide 
    covers everything you need to know: fixtures, teams, live streaming options, and the latest AFL news.
  </p>

  <h2>What is AFL?</h2>
  <p>
    AFL stands for <strong>Australian Football League</strong>, the top professional competition of 
    <strong>Australian Rules Football</strong>. The league began in 1896 as the <strong>Victorian Football League (VFL)</strong> before 
    expanding nationally in 1990, becoming the AFL we know today.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Number of teams:</strong> 18</li>
    <li><strong>Competition format:</strong> Regular season + Finals Series</li>
    <li><strong>Grand Final:</strong> Played annually at the <strong>Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG)</strong> in front of 100,000+ fans</li>
    <li><strong>Most successful clubs:</strong> Collingwood, Essendon, Carlton, Hawthorn, Richmond</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why AFL is Unique</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oval-shaped field</strong> instead of rectangular</li>
    <li><strong>High-scoring nature</strong> with goals worth 6 points</li>
    <li><strong>Physical contact + nonstop running</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Spectacular marks (high catches)</strong> that thrill fans</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s often described as the <em>fastest game on grass</em>, making it a must-watch for sports fans.</p>

  <h2>How AFL Scoring Works</h2>
  <p>AFL’s scoring system is simple but unique:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal (6 points):</strong> When the ball is kicked between the two tall goalposts without being touched.</li>
    <li><strong>Behind (1 point):</strong> When the ball passes between a tall and a short post, or touches a player before crossing the goal line.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This means matches can have <strong>very high scores</strong>, often exceeding 100 points per team.</p>
